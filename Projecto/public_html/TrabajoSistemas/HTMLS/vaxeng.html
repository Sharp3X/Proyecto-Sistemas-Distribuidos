<h1>VAX/VMS</h1>
VMS operating system, developed for the Digital VAX-11 family provides a unified hardware with different performance levels environment. Memory management was often with very limited hardware support.<br><br>
The VAX-11 provided a virtual address space of 32 bits, divided between user and system. The addresses were paged, with a page size of 512 bytes. A user program had three regions (segments), each with a page table with database records and associated length. As support for virtual memory, each entry in the page tables had at least a bit of validity and a set of bits for access protection. The main features of the virtual memory management are:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Allocation of Local pages: There is a maximum limit on the number of residents per process pages. Processes can be driven from memory to avoid overpaging, when a process makes memory again with the same set of pages resident who was expelled.</li>
<li>Page with replacement FIFO buffer and global frameworks: The pager maintains an additional number of page frames that are not allocated to the residents of each process sets. This buffer consists of two lists: a list of modified and a list of free frames. When a process refers to a page which is not in its place, the page fault routine first searches these lists; if found, it adds the page without access to secondary memory. </li> 
<li>Grouping of pages: The small size of the VAX page cause very poor yield if they are individually transferred between memory and disk, to avoid it, the pages of a process are grouped together to be transferred. For reading, for example, pages resident set of a transfer process. For writing, the modified list is transferred.</li>
<li>Swapping:  In certain circumstances, the only way to regain free memory frames is taking full working-set of one or more processes, which take into account the priority and a memory quantum processes.</li>

</ul>
