<h1>Windows</h1>
The memory manager is designed to work with pages ranging from 4 Kbytes to 64 Kbytes. Intel, PowerPC, and MIPS platforms have 4096 bytes per page and DEC Alpha platforms have 8192 bytes per page.<br><br>
User processes on Windows can see whether an address space of 32 bits, allowing 4GB of memory per process. By default a part of this memory is reserved for the operating system so that each user has 2GB of possible addresses and all processes share it.<br><br>
You can change this by restricting the operating system to only 1GB and 3GB for the user.<br><br>
Windows address space:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>0x00000000 to 0x0000FFFF reserved to help programmers to capture null pointer assignments.</li>
<li>0x00010000 to 0x7FFEFFFF address space available to the user. This space is divided into pages that can be loaded into main memory.</li>
<li>0x7FFF0000 to 0x7FFFFFFF a guard page not accessible to the user. What it does is check references to pointers out of range.</li>
<li>0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF system address space. 2GB This area is used by the Windows executive, the micro kernel and device drivers.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Paging</h2>
When a process is created, you can use all the 2GB user space (less than 128 KB). This space is divided into pages of fixed size, either of which can be loaded into the main memory. States of pages:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Available: Pages that are not currently used by this process.</li>
<li>Reserved: Set of contiguous pages of virtual memory manager removed to a process but do not count towards the quota</li>
<li>Assigned: The pages for which the virtual memory manager has reserved space in the paging file.</li>

</ul>
The distinction between reserved and allocated memory is useful because it minimizes the amount of disk space that must be saved to a particular process, keeping free space on disk for further processing; and allows a thread or process declare a request for an amount of memory that can quickly be provided if needed.<br><br>
In Windows when a process is activated for the first time is assigned a certain number of page frames of main memory as working set. When a process refers to a process that is not in main memory, a page is ejected from the process, and brings the new page.<br><br>
When there is space in the memory, the virtual memory manager allows the resident sets of active processes grow. Then brought a new page to the memory without expelling any.<br><br>
When the memory becomes scarce, the virtual memory manager moves pages that have been used over time for each of the processes to swap ago, freeing main memory.<br><br>
